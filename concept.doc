Goal is to create a dle-type grid game like pokedle or NBA grid for league of legends.

Each time the code is run, we should generate a 3x3 grid.
There are a total of six categories for every game.
Each box on the grid should have two cateogries, one from the x-axis and one from the y-axis.
The goal is the guess a league of legends champion that fits the two categories the correspond to a specific box.
Any box could have multiple legal answers, and some could have only one. A box should never have no legal answers.

Some potential categories:
- Region: (Ionia, Demacia, Piltover, etc.)
- Role: (Top, Mid, Support, Multi-role etc.)
- Skin Lines: (High Noon, Arcade, Project, etc.)
- Ability Questions: 
    - E is a Passive Ability, i.e. Vayne, Teemo, etc.
    - Shapeshifter, i.e. Jayce, Nidalee, Gnar, etc.
    - 3-hit Passive, i.e. Akshan, Auroroa, etc.
    - Auto-Attack reset, i.e. Darius, Nasus, etc.
    - Ability has charges, i.e. Rumble, Nilah, etc.
    - Has 2 or more Hard-CC abilities, i.e. Thresh, Alistar, Blitzcrank, etc.
    - Abilities can Change, i.e. Syndra, Viktor, Hwei, Qiyana, etc.
- Resource: (Mana, Energy, Rage, etc.)
- Champion 'class': (Tank, Juggernaut, Enchanter, etc.)
- Species: (Yordle, Human, Void-being, Cat, etc.)
- Primary Damage Type: (AD, AP, Hybrid)
- Range: (less than 250, 250 to 499, 500 or more )
- Starting Base Movespeed: (325, 330, 335, 340, etc.)
- Release Season: (Before Season 1, Season 4, Season 7, etc.)
- Model Size/Gameplay Radius: (55-64, 65-79, 80 or more)

First, cateogires should be picked and a list of correct champions for each cateogry pair should be generated.
Then, the player should be presented with an empty grid that only has the categories.
The player should get nine total guesses. 
- If they get a guess correct for any given square, we should fill in that square with a green-tinted picture of the champion they guessed.
- If they get a guess incorrect for any given square, we should fill in that square with a red-tinted picture of the champion they guessed.
There should also be a 'give-up' button if the player can't think of anything else to guess.

After all nine guesses or the give up button is pressed, we can enter the 'post-game' phase.
In the post game phase, we should do a handful of things.
- Show the player their score.
- Allow the player to click on any individual box to see potential champions that would fit that box's category pair.
- Allow the player to generate a new grid.




other ideas for categories:
- other cc ability context (hasNoCC, hasSlows, hasExactlyOneCC, hasGround, hasRoot, hasStun, hasSilence, etc.)
- has no secondary class (i.e. only figher, only assassin)
